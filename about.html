            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <h4> Information Technology & Cybersecurity</h4>
            <br>
            <p1> Hello, my name is Naveed Noori and welcome to my website! I am from Alpharetta Georgia, but most of my family are from Iran. I am currently enrolled in Kennesaw State University studying information technology with a concentration of Cybersecurity.  </p>
            <br>
            <p2> My most recent professional experience includes working as an IT Cybersecurity Technician, my priorities being management of employee workplaces ensuring proper vulnerability assessments and optimal performance. I’ve also worked at a different company as an IT Technician Assistant to enhance cybersecurity awareness by developing phishing simulations, training calls with employees to educate the dangers of malicious hackers and assisting employees with general computer issues. </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p3>Looking into the future, my most prominent goal is to complete university and further my studies into a master’s degree for either cybersecurity or business. Eventually, I would love to own an IT business that would help improve other businesses’ cybersecurity and overall management of employee computers. </p3>
